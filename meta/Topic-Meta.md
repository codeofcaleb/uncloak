# Topic: Meta
The Meta area is for site discussion and documentation. Currently, resources here are a bit sparse, but we're very responsive in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TYwr4pMS2h). The [[Explanation-Node Categorization]] is the best place to start.

Documentation about the site should aim to follow the [Divio Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/) reference.

### On site maintenance:
Note that the site is limited to 4GB of image content. Prefer using markdown tools like [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io) over including images where possible. Convert all images to SVG before including them in files. Changes to this git repository do not automatically push to the site. This has to be done manually, until we get around to automating it.
