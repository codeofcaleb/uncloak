# topic-Meta
The Meta area is for site discussion and documentation. 

Contributors should start with the [[meta-Uncloak Contributor Guide]]. Ask questions in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TYwr4pMS2h). 

### Notes on site maintenance:
Note that the site is limited to 4GB of image content. Prefer using markdown tools like [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io) over including images where possible. While this obsidian vault will render Tikz drawings, among other formats, the site will not. If you'd like to include a rendered image, save a screenshot of the image to include in the site, and include the rendering code at the bottom of the page in the **Artifacts** section (make one if it doesn't already exist).

Changes to this git repository do not automatically push to the site. This has to be done manually, until we get around to automating it.
